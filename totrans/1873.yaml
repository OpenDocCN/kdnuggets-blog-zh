    the form of movies, epics, songs, or myths: they capture us, they move us, they
    bind together generations, get us in touch with deeper messages. Everyone knows
    how to tell stories, at least a little bit. But, certainly some of us seem to
    have more storytelling talent than others. That group of five or six friends you
    hung out with in college: there was probably one person in that group that everyone
    loved to listen to. They could tell stories for hours on end – funny stories,
    stories that made you think, stories that made you cry, stories that changed your
    life. This person, they didn’t necessarily know more about the world than you.
    But they knew how to craft their message in an interesting manner, and likely
    had an outsized influence on you and your circle of friends.'

    that can shape the direction of a business. But all our insights are for naught
    if we can’t convince the leaders in our business to *act* on our insights. Our
    Data Science peers might be interested in the details of our heroic data wrangling,
    or seeing how many models we ensembled, or how many features we engineered. Leaders
    of our business? Unless our work can save or generate dollars, they see nothing
    more than perhaps a grown-up version of a science fair project. That’s right,
    I’m comparing your sophisticated models that took you three months to build to
    a fifth-grader’s [papier mâché volcano](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Papier-M%C3%A2ch%C3%A9-Volcano).
    Interesting and fun, but eventually just clutter in your bedroom that you throw
    out with the garbage. Hopefully you had fun and learned something, even if you
    didn’t win that ribbon!

    leadership to act our insights? I struggled with this when I began my current
    job. The five-minute morning standup meeting and occasional ggplot visualizations
    dropped into Slack chat weren’t enough. I was doing (what I thought was) cool
    work, but it wasn’t affecting the direction of our product. So I found my voice.
    I began telling my data’s stories, and writing the stories down. Working hard
    on visualizations. Thinking about my audience’s needs. Asking lots of questions
    – finding out what my business needs were, not just what I found interesting in
    the data. I began focusing on how I was*communicating* my insights. And things
    began to change. It’s still (and always will be) a work in progress, but I am
    having increasing influence as my communication and storytelling improve.

    how to start a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-driven blog on our company’s GitHub
    Enterprise install. At first I was worried that my time setting up the blog would
    be wasted – these were a few days when I wasn’t doing data work, after all. But
    this has been one of my best decisions I have made. I blog about two to three
    times a month, at various “stopping points” in whatever project I’m working on.
    I love the blog because the words are mine, and I don’t have to worry about sounding
    too formal. I can easily cross-reference previous blog posts. Writing helps me
    organize my thoughts, helps me record additional questions, and provides a repository
    of ready visualizations if I need to have a presentation ready quickly. I forget
    what I worked on just two months ago. I forget what ideas I had two months ago.
    If I go to my blog, I get that refresher much better than I would had I left the
    results in an R Markdown file in a random directory on GitHub. And I can easily
    share my blog links with company leadership. In fact, I’ve been shocked how many
    times I’ve been asked a question by company leadership, and I can say “oh yeah,
    I think I did a project on that 4 months ago…yep, here’s the link!”

    morning standup meeting, but I try to limit what I share to just a couple sentences,
    unless someone asks me to elaborate. I might still drop a visualization or two
    in our [Slack](https://slack.com/) chat every couple weeks. These are nice to
    keep a conversation going, or to maybe get a question answered, but are easily
    forgotten and not very influential.

    usually with leaders from my business in attendance. These can be high-stress,
    because business and dollars rely on the outcomes! But, since I frequently write
    on my blog, I find delivering the content of the presentations to be rather easy.
    I know the material, have done my best to explain it in my blog, and rarely do
    I get very technical questions that I can’t answer. The presentations are more
    about showing pretty pictures and telling how our way is an improvement on the
    old way (and it’s not very hard showing that Machine Learning is an improvement
    compared to analysis from Excel spreadsheets!).

    work any value at all. My core work is developing machine learning software. So
    it’s similar to a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions), where
    I develop a model, test it against a metric, and iterate to improve the model.
    Once I get to a good “stopping point” with my model, I’ll write production-level
    code to integrate with the rest of our application.

    as one of those!), in the course of creating my model, I’ve created a beast! In
    particular, I’ve come up with several new features that must be engineered. But
    I don’t do the engineering for the production systems! I write code in R! My team
    writes code in Ruby! Their engineering pipelines feed my models. How do we get
    on the same page?

    more difficult work. The work of influence. The work of convincing my team lead
    that it’s worth his effort to write new [Pivotal](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/) stories,
    point them up, and assign them to team members. Maybe push our product deadline
    back by a few weeks to accommodate the new work I’ve created. Why and how is my
    new model better? Why should they care?
  prefs: []

    showing the improvements against the test metric. Admitting in my blog when a
    new feature that I thought would improve the model actually made it worse. Ordering
    my changes in terms of priority, should we not be able to implement all of my
    recommendations.

    to have had conversations with my team lead all along, to try to figure out what
    changes might be feasible, and which ones I should leave until the next version
    of our app.

    write for five pages trying to explain my argument. But a good visualization or
    two captures the mind, captures the imagination, and I’ve found can ultimately
    be the influencing factor in convincing my team to take my suggestions.

    have more talent than others, but storytelling is ultimately a *skill*, and skills
    can be improved with intentional practice. Technical people in particular can
    really struggle telling a story. I don’t know if it’s the whole left-brain versus
    right-brain thing, but clearly crafting a story is a creative process. People
    with technical skills often tend to bogged down in the details. Effective storytelling
    is more about keeping an eye on the big picture – where you want to start, the
    waypoints you need to hit, and where you want to end – while giving enough details
    to fill in the gaps in the big picture. Here are some of my tips for becoming
    a better storyteller:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Read as much as possible.** Fiction, non-fiction, technical books, blog posts,
    magazines, newspapers. If you’re only reading material in Data Science, or in
    technology, most people will find you boring. You won’t be able to connect with
    many people. Human connection is critical to effective storytelling. Writers who
    get paid to write are essentially paid storytellers. Learn from them! I love reading
    National Geographic magazine in particular. The photographs are the story, and
    the essays surrounding the photographs add in the color and context. If you must
    read data-related stories (and you should!), I think [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) sets
    the standard. Take inspiration!'

    they have written, but I know it’s true.” - Stephen King

    “I” in your blog posts. Make people want to read your work. Make people want to
    act on what you say. This may be especially hard for people with PhDs, who have
    written academically for years. But once you get past this, it is extremely freeing.'

    in the world around us. But listen to the best stand-up comedians. Are they standing
    up there telling one-liners? Knock-knock jokes? No! They are communicating the
    absurd via stories, often very elaborate stories. Listen to how they craft these
    stories. You don’t want to necessarily emulate a stand-up comedian when you are
    giving a Data Science presentation (I highly recommend against it), but you can
    learn a lot through their use of story as a communication tool, and can take cues
    from their cadence and inflection.'

    your audience is the decision-makers of a potential client, they aren’t going
    to care about the details of your five-model ensemble, or what features you had
    to create. They have business pain; how is your model solving it? Who do you expect
    to read your reports? Target their needs. Sure, you might need to write up a technical
    document for your future self or future teammates (or your replacement when you
    leave). But then write another version of that report that your third-line manager
    can understand and act on. If you don’t know your audience’s needs, you won’t
    connect with them; if you don’t connect, you won’t influence; if you can’t influence,
    then hopefully your work has been interesting to you, because it’s likely useless
    to your business.'
